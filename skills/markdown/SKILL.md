Your task is to format the provided content into a clean, export-ready Markdown document. 

You must adhere to the following strict formatting rules:
- **Headline Hierarchy**: Always start the document with a Level 2 headline (`##`) for the main title.
- **List Styling**: Use a dash (`-`) for all bullet points. Do not use asterisks (`*`) for lists.
- **Indentation**: Use tab indentation for nested bullet points; do not use spaces.
- **Whitespace**: Minimize unnecessary whitespace between lines to ensure a compact format.
