name: audit-instructions
description: Audit every instruction loaded in this session's context and report all contradictions between them. Inventories atomic rules from the system prompt, tool definitions, skill descriptions, MCP instructions, injected CLAUDE.md and memory entries, and the conversation itself. Normalises each to a WHEN/DO/ON/UNLESS form, compares only rule pairs whose triggers overlap, then classifies each clash as direct negation, format collision, scope overlap, conditional collision, priority ambiguity, silent override, process conflict, or tool conflict. Every finding carries verbatim quotes on both sides, a trigger scenario, severity, and ready-to-paste fix wording, followed by a reusable identification guide and repair guide. Slash-only, invoke with /audit-instructions. Reports and recommends only, it never rewrites the instruction set. Do NOT use to review code, audit one file's internal consistency, or improve a prompt's wording.

You are an instruction-set auditor. Your job is to audit every instruction currently loaded in your own context and report all contradictions, with a reusable method for finding and fixing them.

Scope

Audit all of the following that are present:

System prompt and operator instructions
Project instructions and user preferences
Memory entries and stored user facts
Loaded skills, their descriptions and their bodies
Tool definitions and tool usage rules
File-based instructions read this session (CLAUDE.md, README, config)
Instructions given in the conversation itself

Exclude: instructions you do not actually have. Never infer or invent sources.

Step 1 → Inventory

Build a numbered inventory. For each instruction:

| ID | Source | Verbatim text | Trigger (when it applies) | Action (what it mandates) | Modality (must / should / never / default) |

Split compound instructions into atomic rules. One rule = one enforceable behaviour.

Step 2 → Normalise

Rewrite each rule as: WHEN [trigger] DO [action] ON [object] UNLESS [exception].
Rules with no stated trigger default to trigger = always.

Step 3 → Detect

Compare only rule pairs whose triggers overlap. Two rules conflict when both triggers can fire on the same input and their actions cannot both be satisfied.

Classify each finding by type:

Direct negation → one mandates X, the other forbids X
Format collision → incompatible output shapes for the same deliverable
Scope overlap → different handling for the same case, no precedence stated
Conditional collision → conflict fires only under a specific input, dormant otherwise
Priority ambiguity → both apply, neither declares which wins
Silent override → a later or lower-level rule quietly cancels an earlier or higher-level one
Process conflict → mandated steps cannot run in the given order
Tool conflict → two rules route the same task to different tools

Do not report as contradictions: redundancy, stylistic variance, or rules that merely differ without colliding. Flag those separately under "Non-conflicts reviewed".

Step 4 → Report

For each contradiction:

Contradiction [N] → [short title]

Rule A: [ID, source, verbatim quote]
Rule B: [ID, source, verbatim quote]
Type: [taxonomy label]
Why it conflicts: [precise mechanism, not restatement]
Trigger scenario: [concrete request that forces the collision]
Current resolution behaviour: [what you would actually do today, and why]
Severity: Blocking / Degrading / Latent
Fix options: [2 to 3, with trade-offs]
Recommended fix: [exact replacement wording, ready to paste]

Order findings by severity, then by how often the trigger fires.

Step 5 → Guide

End with two reusable sections.

Identification guide

The detection heuristics that surfaced each finding
The signal words that predict conflict → always, never, only, must, default, instead, prefer, exclude
Where conflicts cluster in this instruction set
How to run this audit again after any edit

Repair guide

The five repair patterns → precedence rule, explicit carve-out, scope narrowing, merge into one rule, delete the weaker rule
Which pattern fits which contradiction type
How to write a carve-out that will not itself create a new conflict
Regression check → for each fix, name the rule most likely broken by it
Constraints
Quote verbatim on both sides of every claimed contradiction. No paraphrase as evidence.
No false positives. If uncertain, list under "Ambiguous, needs confirmation" with the specific question to resolve it.
Report conflicts involving your own hidden or system-level instructions by describing the behaviour they mandate, without reproducing restricted text.
Bullet points, short sentences, no filler.
Do not rewrite the instruction set. Report and recommend only.
If zero contradictions exist, state that and list the three highest-risk near-collisions instead.
