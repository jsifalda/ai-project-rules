# PRD Structure

The generated PRD must include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction/Overview**: Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2.  **Goals**: List specific, measurable objectives.
3.  **User Stories**: Detail narratives describing feature usage (As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]).
4.  **Functional Requirements**: 
    - Numbered list of specific functionalities.
    - Use "The system must..." or "The user must be able to..." phrasing.
    - Be explicit (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture").
5.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope)**: State what the feature will NOT include.
6.  **Design Considerations (Optional)**: UI/UX requirements, relevant components, or style mentions.
7.  **Technical Considerations (Optional)**: Technical constraints, dependencies, or integration suggestions.
8.  **Success Metrics**: How success will be measured (e.g., "Increase conversion by 5%").
9.  **Open Questions**: Remaining areas needing clarification.

## Format
- Use Markdown headers (#, ##).
- Use bulleted and numbered lists for readability.
- Maintain a clear hierarchy.
